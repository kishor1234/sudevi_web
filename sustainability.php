                            <p class="text-justify">Our dyeing machines and equipment dye fabrics with the least amount of water required. We are well aware that the dyeing industry is responsible for the voracious consumption of water. Which is why, <span class="font-weight-bold">at Sudevi Chemicals, we ensure that we consume 50% less water than traditional factories and dyers.</span>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Chemicals used in the dyeing process are dependent on the amount of water consumed, and since our water consumption is minimum, we attain stellar results in minimum chemical effluent generation. We are slowly witnessing a foreseeable increase in water scarcity around the world, and though it may not be mandatory to recycle water, we at Sudevi Chemicals feel it our moral responsibility to bring about a change in this pattern. Thus, we recycle up-to 50% of the effluent generated. Our machines are highly energy efficient and consume only 30 - 40% of the electricity that traditional factories consume.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Reducing water consumption is at the core of being sustainable. As fuel consumption in the industry increases, so does the processing cost and consumption of water. Our fuel consumption is 50% less than other dyeing factories which helps us preserve precious fossil fuels, which are resources becoming even more scarce as the days go by. While it is important to improve and focus on the above we also are mindful of the paper waste we generate and hence most of our operations are paperless and are run by an ERP. We also urge our customers to make transactions with us through paperless mediums as even the smallest deeds can make a significant impact.&nbsp;</p>
