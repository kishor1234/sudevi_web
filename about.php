                    At Sudevi Chemicals, we believe that Sustainable Dyeing can keep the planet from Dying.

                    Sudevi Chemicals was founded in 1972 by the Late Shri. Nilmani Agarwal, in Dombivli. Ever since its humble beginnings, the company has consistently grown, and in the 1980’s Sudevi Chemicals stepped into the realm of processing woven fabrics. With a steady growth in company strength, Sudevi Chemicals has since continued to evolve and innovate and in 2012, set up a unit for the dyeing of knitted fabrics.

                <p class="pb-20">
                    Today Sudevi Chemicals has a dyeing capacity of 7.5 MT/Day and is among the top dyers in India, well equipped with the capability to dye blends and qualities that traditional dyers may find challenging. Our dyeing factory is set up with state of the art machinery which has been mostly imported from Italy and Europe. Mr. Jitendra Agarwal, with his vast experience in the dyeing and processing business, set up the knitted fabric dyeing unit. He was later joined by his son Raghav Agarwal in 2015. Ever since then, the company capacity has been expanded by magnitudes and has further grown to adopt an integrated state of the art garmenting unit.
